Rebuild of the blog code


# TODO

## 1 KBar Search Integration

### kbar integration point

I've left the code comment "kbar integration point" to note where the integration will need to be handled.

## 2 Theme Switching without next.js

I'd like to add theme switching without using next.js dependency and needing to integrate next.js into my build system.

### theme switch button

I've left a code comment "theme switch button" to note where to put the button

## 3 Author bio

I've left lorem ipsum as my author bio

## 4 markdown footnotes

The footnotes aren't rendering, I wonder if remarkgfm might do the trick.

## 5 Build the api routes
