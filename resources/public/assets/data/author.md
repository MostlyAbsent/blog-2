## Software Developer and Amateur Tailor

Hello, I'm Jacob Doran, a passionate software developer with a flair for functional programming, particularly in Clojure. With a decade of experience in both software development and IT support, I've recently transitioned full-time into the world of software development.

### Professional Background
My journey in technology began in IT support, where I honed my problem-solving skills while running a service department; gaining valuable insights into user needs, balanced with the pragmatics of meeting business goals. Over the years, I've embraced the art of crafting software solutions that address real-world challenges.

### Passion for Functional Programming
I thrive on the elegance of functional programming and have a particular fondness for Clojure. My focus is on building not just efficient code, but creating solutions that genuinely enhance the lives of end-users.

### Diverse Language Expertise
I find great value in understanding how different programming languages approach, represent, and solve problems. From the robust typing of TypeScript to the extensibility of Emacs Lisp, the portability of Lua, the versatility of Python, to the command-line prowess of Bash, each language offers a unique perspective.

### Amateur Tailor
Beyond the digital realm, I am also an amateur tailor. The precision and attention to detail required in both coding and tailoring fascinate me. From lines of code to lines of stitching, I find joy in creating things that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

### Looking Ahead
As I continue my journey in software development, my goal is to contribute to meaningful projects, leveraging my skills to build innovative solutions and improve user experiences.

When I'm not immersed in coding or designing, you can find me experimenting with  bringing new ideas to life, online or here in the real.
