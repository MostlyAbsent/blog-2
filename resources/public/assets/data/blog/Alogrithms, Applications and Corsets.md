# Introduction

Already October, it's been pretty quiet blog wise. Primarily I've been working on three things, an algorithms refresher course, job applications, and a corset. None of which lend themselves to topic based blogs without considerable atomization and additional research. Today I'll just address a few broad thoughts I've had about each and see where that gets us.

# Algorithms

I've been running through The Primeagen's Algorithms course on Front End Masters[^1], it's very good - though my experience with it has been a little odd. It's mostly  refresher on the things I learned at Uni back in the late 2000's so I'm not taking away as much low level detail as I thought I might[^2]. With the change in perspective I've had since then I'm finding the content interesting in an academic sense, but I'm not sure of the practical usefulness.

For example implementing a Binary Search Tree; I can't see that I'd be likely to manually write this myself - isn't this better handled either at the language or library level. On the other hand I appreciate the reminders on how these different structures behave computationally. In Clojure there is less concern over memory copy costs and some access costs due to the memory sharing structures used in the persistent primitives underneath lists/vectors etc., which are optimised to reduce the need to worry about these things most of the time. JavaScript, however, has a lot more scope for performance problems if you mismatch data structures and algorithms.

# Job Applications

I've sent out many, and heard very little back. It's a little disheartening, but one must persevere. I'm sure I look terrible on paper, I'm much better in a dynamic conversation - my experience and usefulness comes across much more clearly.

I think once I've finished thinking about the algorithms and integrated the new knowledge I'll have to find a few more projects, specifically ones that aren't quite as wrote as my last two. The Breadit clone was mostly following a step by step - code by numbers - sort of thing. And rebuilding the blog was translating TypeScript React to ClojureScript React. Neither really showed off my ability to independently innovate, problem solve and build things.

They were still very useful, the Breadit clone had be gain an intuition and understanding of React and TypeScript code, build systems and simple debugging. It also gave me an appreciation for Tailwind that I don't see fading any time soon. The ClojureScript rebuild further developed my understanding of React, and gave me an appreciation for the complexities of state management that could come out of system if you don't think ahead a bit.

# Corset

To make sure the silhouette is right for the wedding suit I'm making a corset. The pattern I'm working from is a Laughing Moon 113[^3] and it's quite a straightforward pattern and instructions. The sewn grommets for the lacing are going to take a good amount of practise before I do them on the final version, the ones on this first mock up are atrocious. I think there will be a second mock up though, rather than just a few little sizing tweaks, so I should have the time to get decent at them.
