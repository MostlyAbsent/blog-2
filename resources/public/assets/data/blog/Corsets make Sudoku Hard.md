summary: I've been developing a Sudoku app for my website, aiming to finish it last week, but I got sidetracked adjusting a corset. Despite the distraction, progress on the corset is going well, and I plan to refocus on the Sudoku app as my primary project this week.

# Corsets make Sudoku Hard

I'm building a little Sudoku app to add to the site[^1], I estimated having it done last week, including a dive into traffic routing to docker containers... unfortunately I got nerd sniped. 

I'm on the third size adjustment for the corset, and it's been consuming my efforts for a while. The work on the corset was flowing really well, and by the time the coutil and boning arrive I should have worked out the kinks in fitting the pattern.

This week I'm going to focus on the Sudoku app as my primary project and general programming as the side projects.
